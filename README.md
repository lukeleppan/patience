# Patience: The Proof of Patience Coin

Patience allows you to earn $PATIENCE by simply waiting. Over time, the amount of claimable $PATIENCE increases up to a maximum of 50. The more you wait, the more you get. However, anyone at any time can claim the $PATIENCE.

When it's claimed, the balance resets to 0. Then there is a 30 second cooldown before the next round begins. It then takes a random amount of time between 1 and 12 hours to reach 50.
